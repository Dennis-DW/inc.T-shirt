# React + Vite Landing Page Design

This template provides a minimal setup to quickly set up a React application with Vite, offering Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for efficient development. Additionally, it includes ESLint rules for maintaining code quality.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

5. **Explore the Landing Page Design:**
   The project includes a landing page design with React components and styles. You can modify the existing components or create new ones to customize the landing page according to your needs.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for your React application.
  - `components/`: Houses reusable React components.
  - `styles/`: Includes stylesheets, such as CSS or SCSS, for styling your components.
  - `App.jsx`: The main entry point for your application.
- `public/`: Holds static assets, such as images or fonts.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the landing page by modifying the existing components, updating styles, and adding new features. The project is structured to facilitate easy development and maintenance.

## Additional Plugins

This project utilizes two official plugins:
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react):** Integrates React with Vite using Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc):** Utilizes SWC for Fast Refresh in React applications.

## Building for Production

When your landing page design is ready for production, you can create a production build using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed to a web server.

Explore and enjoy building your landing page with React and Vite! If you have any questions or need further assistance, refer to the official documentation of Vite and React for more details.
